1. app.use(path ,callback)  => often use to apply middleware to all routes that are coming in.
                            placed at above of all http methods(get,post,..) to apply all.

2. express.urlencoded({extended , inflate , limit , verify , ...}) return Object
 => built in middleware fun: It parses incoming requests with URL-encoded
    payloads and is based on a body parser

3. express.json([options (just like urlencoded)]) return Object
=> built in middleware fun : It parses incoming request with JSON payloads and is based
    on a body-parser

4. express.static ( root , [options]) return Object 
root - describes the root dir: from which to serve static assets 
=> built in middleware fun: it serves static files and is based on serve-static

What are Static files ?
Files that do not change in user's input or action , like images, JS files,CSS files,video files,
even web pages . Normally we put them all into public directory

The next() function is a function in the Express router that, when invoked, 
executes the next middleware in the middleware stack. If the current middleware 
function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to 
the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
